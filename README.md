Tamamo Bot is a discord bot I created for personal uses.

# Main Features

  - Written in Python and hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
  - Fetch images with sources from Gelbooru
  - Fetch current PDT time from [World Time API](http://worldtimeapi.org/)
  - Scrape and serialize banners data from [Fate Grand/Order Cirnopedia](https://fate-go.cirnopedia.org/)
  - Store and send user-defined gifs/animated emoji on demand.
